# COMP296-BrookdaleCC
Capstone Project

Graduation requirement for Brookdale: Create a database and create a user interface.

My choice was to create a small interface for a database to store customer information.

https://www.youtube.com/user/thenewboston was used as my primary source to learn how to work with JavaFX and SceneBuilder

I used SceneBuilder to create the GUI.
